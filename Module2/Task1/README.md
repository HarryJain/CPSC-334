# Module 2, Task 1: Interactive Devices

## Task Description
This first task of the Interactive Devices module aims to increase familiarity with the given hardware by requiring a creative solution to a resource-constrained problem. Namely, it had to meet the following design constraints:
- Utilize exactly the three given sensors: a momentary button, a SPST switch, and an analog joystick.
- Demonstrate three different modes of operation, i.e. states of the system that alter the effect an input action has on the output, directly via user input
- Have some digital output, audio, or video.
- Must operate on the Raspberry Pi using the GPIO pins.

The two primary challenges are to:
1. Use the analog joystick input with the strictly digital pins of the Raspberry Pi.
2. Manage switching between three state with only one binary switch.

## Marco Polo: A Classic Pool Game Brought to the Terminal
In preparation for a variety of game ideas for Module 2, Task 2, I used Module 1, Task 1 to address the idea of movement within a space via the joystick.
